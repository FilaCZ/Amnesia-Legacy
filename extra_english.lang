		This is the end. THE END. I can´t do it. I can´t take any more. I am hearing voices... they care for me, trying to help me to make me sane and reasonable again.
		I must listen to their calling. I MUST!![br][br]
		What the hell?! Is it a dream? Is it real? HELP ME, PLEASE... I AM BEGGING YOU!! Back again, I can hear them again, offering a medicine.
		THE CURE! They will set me free for once. HAHAHAHAAAAA!![br][br]
		Too late... laying on the table, what a fool I am. Took the poison to help my sanity. Poison was served by voices in my head. It was my wish after all.
		Better dead than being lost in here, in my own head. Last thing I truly remember is a key, key from the library... and a painting. Use it!! SAVE YOURSELF...

		To anyone brave or foolish enough to be here:[br][br]
		All my prisoners started to die due to very aggressive unknown disease. There are more unholy things happening here, they keep reanimating. Bloody undead! Something is happening. Their aggressivity is increasing.
		It seems like there are few kinds of them, these bloody freaks are not the same... hell I know it! These things are fighting amongst each other, apparently there is more than one kind. They are gathering 'their own' ones. Now the worst kind is left in this prison.
		In case something would go terribly wrong I barricaded the entrance and hoarded useful things, including my big hammer to fight those beasts.[br][br]
		Hopefully, any aid will appear soon, I am too old to fight them... and perhaps sick too, I don´t feel well lately. If I turn into this monstrosity, don´t show mercy and finish all this dirty work once for all.

		The Corruption has come to our shrine. The sacred orb of light was destroyed. It started in the main hall. You can't get there now. The main door is riddled with some strange ulcers.
		Ulcers spread in the basement. A ghost of a warrior began to walk here. Whoever met him directly did not survive.[br][br]
		These mysteries are too dangerous even for the Secretary of the temple. But before I left this place I managed to find several parts of the Sacred orb of light.
		I hid one into the secret place of the knighthood where the pedestal is located too. The second part is located here in this locked table. The key is in the cabinet.[br][br]

		Mysterious runes appeared in one room in this part of the temple. I have no idea what it means, but some are dangerous. Never step on the red ones.
		They are difficult to distinguish from black ones. It is necessary to shine a lamp on them. White runes indicate a safe place.
